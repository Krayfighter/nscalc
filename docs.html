		<h3>Welcome to the Help Documentation</h3>
		<p>
			This is the user guide for nscalc, the following sections
			will quide you through the various compponents of the application
		</p>
		<p>
			for a more indepth guide to things like installation and contributing
			see the README.md from <a href="https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git/README.md">the github page</a>

		<h4><a name="ui">The UI</a></h4>
		<p>
			One of the goals of nscalc if for a simple,<br />
			and practicle user inter (UI) one of the few<br />
			ui elements that may need explaining is the<br />
			View -> Loaded Functions menu. what it does<br />
			it it programatically displays the functions,<br />
			and constants (like pi, and sqaure root).there<br />
			should be a way to make your own scriptin the<br />
			future, but curently that is what you get
		</p>
		<h5>special buttons</h5>
		<p>
			there are several button, particularly at<br />
			the bottom of the calculator. the buttons<br />
			are labeled by &#187;, &#171;, and &#8592;
		</p>
		<p>
			&#8592;is used for deleting the right-most<br />
			character from the current equation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#171;, and &#187; are for loading the<br />
			previous inputs to the calculator. for instance<br />
			if you were to mistype a command, and it returns<br />
			and error, you can use the &#171; to bring it back<br />
			and fix it, or if you go too far back, you<br />
			can come back forward with &#187;
		</p>
		<h4><a name="inputs">Input Methods</a></h4>
		<p>
			nscalc has two distinct methods for entering<br />
			equations into the calculator. The first is <br />
			clicking the buttons in the UI (the graphics)<br />
			The second method is to type ccharacters using <br />
			the keyboard. I have worked to make these input<br />
			methods work seemlessly together
		</p>
		<h4><a name="dialogs">Other Dialogs</a></h4>
		<p>
			If you have gotten to this point, you probably<br />
			have found the File -> Help menu. If you did not<br />
			know already, that opened up this dialog or secondary<br />
			window. there are others though, and they have some<br />
			unique functionalities that will be documented in this<br />
			section of the documentation.
		</p>
		<h5>View -> Loaded Functions</h5>
		<p>
			This menu option opens up a dialog with only one<br />
			feature, a list of functions. these functions can<br />
			be used to perform specific mathematic operations<br />
			and if you click on them, it will copy the function<br />
			into your current equation.<br />
			<b><strong>There is currently a bug that does not allow clicking the loaded functions and copying them into your current equation. IT WILL CRASH if you click them</strong></b>
