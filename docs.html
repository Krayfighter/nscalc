        <h4><a name="ui">The UI</a></h4>
        <p>
            One of the goals of nscalc if for a simple,<br />
            and practicle user inter (UI) one of the few<br />
            ui elements that may need explaining is the<br />
            View -> Loaded Functions menu. what it does<br />
            it it programatically displays the functions,<br />
            and constants (like pi, and sqaure root).there<br />
            should be a way to make your own scriptin the<br />
            future, but curently that is what you get
        </p>
        <h5>special buttons</h5>
        <p>
            there are several button, particularly at<br />
            the bottom of the calculator. the buttons<br />
            are labeled by &#187;, &#171;, and &#8592;
        </p>
        <p>
            &#8592;is used for deleting the right-most<br />
            character from the current equation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The &#171;, and &#187; are for loading the<br />
            previous inputs to the calculator. for instance<br />
            if you were to mistype a command, and it returns<br />
            and error, you can use the &#171; to bring it back<br />
            and fix it, or if you go too far back, you<br />
            can come back forward with &#187;
