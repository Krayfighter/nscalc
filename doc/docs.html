		<h2>Welcome to the Help Documentation</h2>
		<p>
			This is the user guide for nscalc, the following sections
			will quide you through the various compponents of the application
		</p>
		<p>
			for a more indepth guide to things like installation and contributing
			see the README.md from <a href="https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git/README.md">the github page</a>

		</ul>
		<h3><a name="ui">The UI</a></h3>
		<p>
			One of the goals of nscalc if for a simple,
			and practicle user inter (UI) one of the few
			ui elements that may need explaining is the
			View -> Loaded Functions menu. what it does
			it it programatically displays the functions,
			and constants (like pi, and sqaure root).there
			should be a way to make your own scriptin the
			future, but curently that is what you get
		</p>
		<h4>special buttons</h4>
		<p>
			there are several button, particularly at
			the bottom of the calculator. the buttons
			are labeled by &#187;, &#171;, and &#8592;
		</p>
		<p>
			&#8592;is used for deleting the right-most
			character from the current equation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The &#171;, and &#187; are for loading the
			previous inputs to the calculator. for instance
			if you were to mistype a command, and it returns
			and error, you can use the &#171; to bring it back
			and fix it, or if you go too far back, you
			can come back forward with &#187;
		</p>
		<h3><a name="inputs">Input Methods</a></h3>
		<p>
			nscalc has two distinct methods for entering
			equations into the calculator. The first is 
			clicking the buttons in the UI (the graphics)
			The second method is to type ccharacters using 
			the keyboard. I have worked to make these input
			methods work seemlessly together
		</p>
		<h3><a name="dialogs">Other Dialogs</a></h3>
		<p>
			If you have gotten to this point, you probably
			have found the File -> Help menu. If you did not
			know already, that opened up this dialog or secondary
			window. there are others though, and they have some
			unique functionalities that will be documented in this
			section of the documentation.
		</p>
		<h4>View -> Loaded Functions</h4>
		<p>
			This menu option opens up a dialog with only one
			feature, a list of functions. these functions can
			be used to perform specific mathematic operations
			and if you click on them, it will copy the function
			into your current equation.
			<strong>This currently does not work due to a bug</strong>
		</p>
		<h4>File -> Update</h4>
		<p>
			This is for an as of yet unimplemented feature for
			updating the calculator from within itself. It should
			be released sometime soon.
		</p>
		<h3><a name="advanced">Advanced Usage</a></h3>
		<p>
			This section of the article explains advanced
			topics such as large numbers, and ratios that
			are listed below.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>very large numbers</li>
			<li>ratios</li>
		</ul>
		<f4>Large Numbers</f4>
		<p>
			This section covers unreasonably large numbers,
			for example, the mass of the earth 5.9722×10²⁴ kg.
			This number would not fit into a normal python Integer
			so there are ways around that. nscalc uses E
			notation for such numbers, which you can learn about
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation">here</a>.
			The function for this is in nscalc is called <code>enotation</code>, and it takes
			a number inside of quotes like this -> enotation('5.9722e24')
