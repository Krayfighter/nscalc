# nscalc
New Scripting Calculator

graphical docs are available under File -> Help

internal docs only currently in the form of code comments


# support

support for linux natively with setup scripts for dependancies


possible support for windows is coming



# installation


available only from github

command line git is `very` recommended but not technically required


for linux, download the source from https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git

then run
```
cd nscalc # move into the application directory
cd setup # move into the setup directory
./setup.sh # run setup script
cd ../ # move back into application directory
./main.py # should run the calculator
```

currently python3, and pip are required before the installation
scripts can handle the process, better support may come later




for windows ### expoerimental

either download and unzip from https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git

ir if git is installed -> git clone https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git

then

'''
this part needs added
no current windows setup script support
'''
