# nscalc
New Scripting Calculator version 0.1.1

graphical docs are available under File -> Help

internal docs only currently in the form of code comments


# support

support for linux natively with setup scripts for dependancies


possible support for windows is coming



# installation


available only from github

command line git is `very` recommended but not technically required


for linux, download the source from https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git

then run
```
cd nscalc # move into the application directory
cd setup # move into the setup directory
./setup.sh # run setup script
cd ../ # move back into application directory
./main.py # should run the calculator
```

currently python3, and pip are required before the installation
scripts can handle the process, better support may come later




for windows ### expoerimental


step 1, choosing installation method

do you have git installed? if you do, but if you do not
know the answer to that quaestion, the answer
is no, and in that case use the following setup

either download and unzip from https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git

if git is installed -> git clone https://github.com/Krayfighter/nscalc.git

then

'''
this part needs added
no current windows setup script support
